# Project Name

**Author**: Dana Voros and Harrison Cogswell
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
https://git.heroku.com/hc-dv-bookap.git
Full-stack book searching application, using Google Books API, where a user can search for books by title or author, 
and will be shown a search list including titles, authors, cover images, and a short synopsis

## Getting Started
`npm init` with node.js installed, and then `npm i` to install node package dependencies express, ejs, dotenv, and superagent

## Architecture
Uses express to do server heavy-lifting, ejs to embed javascript and partials into 'public/' ejs views, 
uses superagent to read Google's free Book API
